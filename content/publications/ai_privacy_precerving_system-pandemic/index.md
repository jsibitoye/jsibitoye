abstract: |
  The COVID-19 pandemic exposed fundamental weaknesses in traditional contact-tracing and data-sharing systems, where centralized architectures often compromised user privacy and response speed.  
  This paper proposes a **federated learning-based contact-tracing framework** integrated with **zero-trust network architecture (ZTNA)** to achieve secure, privacy-preserving, and scalable public-health monitoring.  
  The system leverages decentralized model training on user devices, enabling anonymized data aggregation and real-time threat detection without exposing sensitive personal information.  
  Experimental simulations demonstrate that the approach enhances outbreak response accuracy by 28 % while maintaining strict data confidentiality, making it a viable model for future pandemic management and critical health-security applications.

summary: |
  Proposes a federated learning and zero-trust architecture for privacy-preserving COVID-19 contact tracing and pandemic response.
