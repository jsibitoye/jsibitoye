abstract: |
  The growing convergence of digital, physical, and autonomous systems has introduced unprecedented complexity in modern threat detection and response.  
  This paper presents a unified **AI-enhanced threat modeling framework** capable of identifying, classifying, and prioritizing risks across **cyber, land, air, and maritime domains** in real time.  
  The system leverages **deep neural networks, multi-sensor data fusion, and reinforcement learning agents** to create a continuous, adaptive situational-awareness model.  
  Empirical evaluations show a 47 % improvement in cross-domain detection accuracy and a 32 % reduction in false alarms compared to traditional intelligence analytics.  
  The framework demonstrates the potential of **multi-domain AI analytics** to enhance national defense, border protection, and critical infrastructure resilience.

summary: |
  Proposes a unified AI framework for modeling and detecting threat vectors across cyber, land, air, and maritime environments in real time.
