abstract: |
  Modern cloud infrastructures powering U.S. critical sectors face escalating risks from sophisticated cyber adversaries exploiting misconfigurations and lateral-movement vulnerabilities.  
  This research introduces a **Zero-Trust Cloud Security Architecture (ZTA)** integrated with **AI-driven policy orchestration** to enforce adaptive trust boundaries, verify every transaction, and automate incident containment.  
  The system dynamically evaluates behavioral telemetry across microservices and applies machine-learning-based policy refinement for continuous compliance.  
  Experiments demonstrate a 41 % reduction in lateral-threat propagation time and 36 % faster anomaly remediation compared to static rule-based systems.

summary: |
  Presents an AI-orchestrated Zero-Trust framework for securing cloud infrastructures in critical sectors of the U.S. economy.
