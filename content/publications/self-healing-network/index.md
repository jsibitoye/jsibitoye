abstract: Modern networked systems are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks that compromise operational integrity, disrupt services, and incur significant economic and reputational losses. Traditional reactive approaches to network recovery are often manual, time-consuming, and insufficient for today's scale and complexity. This paper presents a novel architecture for self-healing networks that autonomously detect, diagnose, and recover from cyber-induced disruptions using AI-driven root cause analysis (RCA).
