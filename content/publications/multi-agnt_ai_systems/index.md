abstract: |
  The global expansion of FinTech ecosystems has introduced complex challenges in detecting cross-border fraud, regulatory non-compliance, and digital money laundering.  
  This research presents a **multi-agent artificial intelligence (MAAI)** framework designed to autonomously monitor, detect, and respond to anomalous financial behaviors across decentralized financial infrastructures.  
  The system integrates **reinforcement learning, blockchain-based audit trails, and explainable AI (XAI)** to enhance transparency, trust, and regulatory compliance.  
  Experiments conducted on real-world FinTech datasets demonstrate a 92 % detection accuracy and 38 % reduction in false-positive rates compared to traditional rule-based systems.  
  The framework lays the groundwork for **AI-governed, self-regulating financial systems** capable of safeguarding digital economies at scale.

summary: |
  Introduces a multi-agent AI framework for real-time fraud detection, transparency, and compliance in cross-border FinTech systems.

This paper proposes a **multi-agent AI surveillance framework** capable of identifying, auditing, and responding to fraudulent activities across digital financial systems in real time.  
By combining **AI governance principles**, **blockchain transparency**, and **autonomous decision-making**, the research establishes a foundation for a next-generation FinTech security model that balances innovation with regulatory accountability.
