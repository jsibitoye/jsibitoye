  Credit card fraud poses a major challenge to financial institutions, causing severe economic losses and eroding consumer trust.  
  This study applies **supervised machine learning algorithms** to detect fraudulent transactions in an anonymized dataset of over 200,000 records.  To handle the <1 % fraud imbalance, the **Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)** was employed.   Models including **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and ANN** were evaluated using recall, precision, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.  Results show that **ensemble methods**, particularly **XGBoost**, delivered the highest detection accuracy and recall, proving most effective for combating financial fraud.  
  <br>
  The work demonstrates that adaptive AI models can enhance security and reliability in modern financial systems.

Josh Ibitoye will present his research on **AI-based credit card fraud detection systems** at the *IEEE 2026 Conference* in Stanford, California.  

This session explores how **machine learning and ensemble models** like XGBoost can minimize undetected fraud and strengthen financial systems through adaptive analytics.

> “Our goal is to help financial institutions deploy real-time, explainable, and intelligent fraud detection solutions.”
